## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- 7-1 Pattern
- [Sass] (https://sass-lang.com/) - CSS framework


### What I learned

This was a bit of a layout challenge. Particularly dealing with the "wings" in the margins on desktop view. I'm still not entirely happy with the responsiveness in these sections. This project was great practice for grid layout.

I found it necessary to modify some of the provided artwork. The .svgs had extra white space that made layout difficult. I used Adobe Illustrator to fix the svgs. 

### Continued development

This project has convinced me I need some more practice with css grid.

### Useful resources

- [CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/) - I used this site to figure out grid layout for this project. This site is a great resource for any CSS question.
